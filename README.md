# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Blog Post Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for the blog post project of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. The project involves exploring a dataset, performing data analysis, and communicating findings through a blog post.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply data science techniques to a chosen dataset, derive meaningful answers to a set of 3-5 questions, and present them in a clear and engaging manner. The analysis is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, and the findings are summarised in a blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@judeking_21019/a-look-at-the-tokyo-2023-2024-airbnb-datasets-4abe53b6c0eb).

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with EDA and the analysis of the questions
- `src/`: Python functions to ease importation of data 
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by git.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Configuration for pre-commit hooks.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python package dependencies required for the project.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Parthian-Sunrise/udacity-ds-project-blog.git
2. **Navigate to the repository:**
   ```bash
   cd udacity-ds-project-blog
3. **Create virtual environment (optrional)**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
4. **Install all requirements**
  ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
5. **Set up pre-commits**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
Now launch in any IDE you wish
